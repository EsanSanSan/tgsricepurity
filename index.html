        <h1>The (Unofficial) TGS Rice Purity Test!</h1>
        <p class="flavor-text">            The TGS Rice Purity test is an opportunity to bond with other current and former TGS students over the experiences TGS has to offer, from the most heartwarming to the most traumatizing experiences. Your score determines how experienced you are, so if you did it, admit it! <br> <br> Questions get more unlikely and more absurd the further down you are on the list. A lower score indicates more experience, so it isn't necessarily bad. <br> Test made by Ethan, please let me know if you have any question suggestions. Also all submissions are not recorded or sent anywhere - if you don't believe me, check the source code. </p>
